Rick And Morty App is an application built with SwiftUI to display a list of characters. It follows **Clean Architecture** and **MVVM** pattern, ensuring proper separation of concerns and scalability.


## üöÄ Features

- Displays a list of characters with their image, name, origin, gender, and an icon indicating if they are a favorite.
- Gender filtering.
- Detailed view of each character with the option to mark them as a favorite.
- Favorite characters are persisted in a database and restored upon app launch.
- Supports deep links (`jmrickandmorty://character/{id}`).

## üéØ Next Steps

- Implement caching for remote data by storing it in a local database (Core Data). Using reactive programming, first display the data from the local database, then update it with new data as it becomes available
- Implement searcher.
- Improve Unit Tests.
- Improve GraphQL requests.
- Implement UI and snapshots Tests.
- Implement loading state (Shimmer).
